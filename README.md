## Description

This is an application of a weather forecast analysis. Search a city that you want and it will display the forecast of that hour and it will display a 5 day forecast to get ahead on the weather. If you want to look back at the cities you've search, don't worry. All cities that you have searched will be saved to the left hand side for you to click back to.
